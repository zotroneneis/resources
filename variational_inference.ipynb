    "A latent variable is the opposite of an *observed* variable. This means that a latent variable is not directly observed but inferred from other variables which are observed. [This book](https://learnche.org/pid/contents) provides a nice conceptual example:\n",

    "Consider your overall health. There are multiple measurements we can use to assess health, were each measurement is looking at a certain physical property, for example blood pressure or body temperature. However, 'health' remains an abstract concept that cannot be measured directly. In this sense, health is a latent variable, whereas blood pressure and body temperature are observable variables."

    "\n",
    "Variational inference is a machine learning method which allows us to approximate probability distributions. In many real world problems we are faced with probability distributions that can't be computed. This especially often happens when a distribution involves latent variables. Therefore, we need strategies to approximate such distributions. Variational inference is one method for doing this. Several other methods exist which broadly fall into two classes: methods that rely on *stochastic* approximations (like [Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo)) and those that rely on deterministic approximations (like variational inference).\n",
    "\n",
    "A key characteristic of variational inference is that it *reframes* the original problem (computing some probability distribution) into a simpler problem which can be solved. Different to this, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling directly approximates the target distribution by sampling from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high level example for variational inference is given [here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-variational-inference):   \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:** Variational inference is similar to what often happens when attending a presentation or lecture. Someone in the audience asks the presenter a very difficult answer which she can't answer. Instead of answering the original, difficult question, the presenter reframes the question into an easier one which can be answered exactly."
